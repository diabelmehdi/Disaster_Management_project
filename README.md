# Disaster_Management_project

In the last couple of years, almost every country has seen a dramatic increase in the number of disasters
and crises. Increased population, climate change and technical progress has resulted in breakdowns
of energy grids, floods, wildfires, and technical accidents such as destruction of dams and oil
leakages. Unfortunately, very view countries commit sufficient resources to disaster management, regardless
of past experience. Because of the lack of real infrastructure for responding to disasters and
crisis, it is usually very difficult for people responsible for managing events to respond quickly and
effectively, and it is also very difficult for the people affected by such an event to respond to it accordingly.
In this report, we will present a web-based system for managing disasters and crisis to help the
victims or the emergency cases to get in contact with rescue helpers quickly also to avoid huge damages
in order to help the maximum people in a short amount of time. This application contains three
different pages each of these had specific functionality. The main objective of this report is to describe
functionality of the application then an explanation of the components building the disaster management
application and their relations to each other in third part Description of the individual implementation
on the backend, the fourth part will be an installation guide of all steps required to put the application
into operation and on last part we will show a simulation and the usage of the application.
